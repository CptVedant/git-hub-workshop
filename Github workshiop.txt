	*settiung up & configuring git*
	->install git bash
	->run git bash
	->$ git config --global user.name "CptVedant"
	->$ git config --global user.email "vedantvijayparab@gmail.com"
	
Clone & status
->Clone-clonning a repo on local system
->git clone <--link-->
->open local ide and open a folder copy the link from repo code(the green button, and the the copy symbol)
->open terminal and type "git clone https://github.com/CptVedant/GitHub-Workshop.git"
->git status is used to under stand the status of file
->git add "file name" is used to make git awre of the changes
->git commit is used to confirm change i.e : git commit -m "new initial comment" 
->to save multiple file we use "git add."
->before using "git add" we save the file and press (ctrl s) in terminal

Push
->push used to upload content repo to remote repo
->git push origin main
->so if we check the file later in git hub we can see that the github was updated

git branches
it is used when there are multiple teams working on same project.
hence this can be used to make prototype branches
>git branch -M main
this is used to change the branch name (mostly used to change the old branch name from master to main)

>git checkout<branch name>
this is used to switch the branch u are currenty in

>git checkout -b <branch name>
to switch to new branch

>git branch -d "branch name"
this code is used to delete the branch
note : u cant delete the branch which u are currently in.

Working on branches
>we worked on diffrent branches which made differnt code

merging code
git diff <branch name>

git merge <branch name>
we can hence merge the different branch 
then add and commit and push
